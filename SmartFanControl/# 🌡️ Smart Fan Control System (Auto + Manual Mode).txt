## 🧠 Features

- 🌡️ **Automatic Mode:** Adjusts fan speed based on temperature (25°C to 40°C)
- 🔘 **Manual Override Mode:** Toggle fan on/off using a pushbutton
- 💡 **LED Indicator:** LED shows fan ON/OFF state in manual mode
- 💾 **Debouncing:** Accurate button handling using millis() logic
- 🔧 **Real Industry Logic:** Simulates smart cooling used in embedded HVAC systems

## 🧪 How It Works

- **TMP36 sensor** reads temperature
- Arduino maps temp to fan PWM speed (0–255)
- Pushbutton toggles between:
  - Auto mode (PWM based on temp)
  - Manual mode (Fan ON/OFF toggle)
- LED lights up when fan is ON in manual mode
