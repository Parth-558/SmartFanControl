# 🌡️ Smart Fan Control System (Auto + Manual Mode)

This project is a real-world embedded system that controls a fan using both **temperature input** and **manual button input**.  
It simulates how industrial fans or HVAC systems work — using sensors, modes, and logic in Embedded C/Arduino.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ **Auto Mode:** Adjusts fan speed based on temperature (25°C to 40°C)
- ✅ **Manual Mode:** Button toggles fan ON/OFF manually
- ✅ **LED indicator** to show fan state
- ✅ **PWM fan control** using `analogWrite()`
- ✅ **Button debounce logic** using `millis()`

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Arduino Uno (ATmega328P)
- TMP36 Temperature Sensor
- Push Button
- LED (as fan indicator)

## 🚦 How It Works

### 🔁 Auto Mode (Default)
- Reads temperature using `analogRead()`
- Uses `map()` and `constrain()` to convert it to PWM value
- Fan runs faster as temperature rises
- LED ON if fan is running

### 🔘 Manual Mode
- On button press, system enters manual mode
- Fan toggles ON/OFF with each press
- LED shows fan state

### 🧠 Debouncing
- `millis()` and `static` variables used to avoid false triggers
